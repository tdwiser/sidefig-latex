	Wrapping text around a figure (or, more generally, any box-shaped region) is a tricky subject in \LaTeX.
	Plain \TeX\ has a powerful command, \verb|\parshape|, which directs \TeX\ to flow a paragraph within a defined region, with the geometry defined line-by-line.
	
	Various packages (e.g.~\texttt{wrapfig}) exist to facilitate this process for \LaTeX\ users.
	However, \verb|\parshape| (and another powerful command, \verb|\everypar|, which allows wrapping across multiple paragraphs) are overwritten by \LaTeX\ \verb|list| environments, including \verb|itemize| and \verb|enumerate|.
	This causes typical approaches to fail when used near \verb|list|s.
	
	\texttt{sidefig} is a package which attempts to allow wrapping text around rectangular regions even in the presence of \texttt{list}s.


	Here are some features of \texttt{sidefig}, which you can see demonstrated below:
	\begin{itemize}

		\sidefig{R}{\usebox{\samplebox}}
		\item Text wrapping continues to work even if you start a list.
		For example, this line will break a little bit earlier to make room for the figure at right.
		
		\item Sublists are also supported:
		

		\begin{enumerate}
			
			\item like so.

			\sidefig{L}{\usebox{\samplebox}}
			
			\item If you add a \verb|\sidefig| in a list, the package tries hard to make things look right even across multiple levels.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item Now we're back in the outer list and the indent is hopefully right.
			
		\sidefig[Fig.~1: A caption describing the figure above.]{R}{\usebox{\samplebox}}
		\item Captions are also possible using an optional parameter to \verb|\sidefig|.
		
		\item Usage:
		
		\verb|\sidefig[|\emph{(caption)}\verb|]{L|\emph{ or }\verb|R}{|\emph{(content)}\verb|}| right before any paragraph or \verb|\item|.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\pagebreak %%% this is necessary to appease the coming sidefig, which would otherwise be typeset across a page boundary
	
	\renewcommand{\sidecapstyle}[1]{\uppercase{#1}}
	
	\section*{Additional Features}

	\sidefig[Caption with redefined style]{R}{\usebox{\samplebox}}
	The style of the caption can be controlled by redefining \verb|\sidecapstyle|.
	The default is
	\begin{quote}
		\verb|\def\sidecapstyle{\centering\small\it}|.
	\end{quote}
	\verb|\sidecapstyle| can also take an option, if you like, as in
	\begin{quote}
		\verb|\renewcommand{\sidecapstyle}[1]{\uppercase{#1}}|.
	\end{quote}
	
	
	The spacing between the content and the caption can be controlled with
	\begin{quote}
		\verb|\setlength{\sidecapskip}{|\emph{(length)}\verb|}|,
	\end{quote}
	default \verb|2pt|.
	
	If you don't want to be next to the \verb|\sidefig| any more, use \verb|\MoveBelowBox|.
	This command is called automatically if you add a \verb|\sidefig| that would otherwise overlap a previous one.
	
	\subsection*{Known Issues}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Various issues around page breaks.
		Current behavior is to raise an error if the sidefig would go below the ostensible end of the page.
		If the box overflows by just a little, \TeX\ may put it there anyway, and everything is fine (despite the error); if it instead moves the box to the next page, the word wrap fails.
		Since the behavior is unpredictable, an error is raised.
		
		This needs to be made much more robust.
		
		\item There also seems to be some mysterious errors involving page breaks, lists, and \verb|\prevdepth|, but they sometimes vanish after solving the page overflow issue.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Acknowledgements}
	
	This code is heavily based off of the Plain \TeX\ package \verb|insbox| by Micha\l{} Gulczy\'nski, available at \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/insbox}.
	
	Not all features of \verb|insbox| are available due to poor interactions with \verb|list|s.
	Many things have been wrapped-around or otherwise rearranged to accommodate \verb|list|s, but the core functionality is due to \verb|insbox|.
